For my user history approach I reused the trie for the dictionary, I did this because the same type of text prediction
would have been done with the user history trie as a dictionary trie, and it makes good use of the already written methods instead 
of trying to reinvent the wheel by writing something else or using entirely different logic for a premade data structure.
